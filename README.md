# Customer-segmentation-using-R


In the past few years, e-commerce business has placed a greater emphasis on 
delivering the better customer service. Building stronger customer relationships aids
businesses in generating profits as well as customer happiness and retention. 
Customer segmentation is a useful tool for identifying unmet customer demand. This 
work solves the customer segmentation problem by improving the performance
of K-means clustering algorithm by optimizing Sum of Squared Error using Elbow 
method. To aid K-means Clustering in calculating the optimal number of clusters, the 
Sum of Squared Error is used. Customer segmentation is a pivotal process in 
marketing strategy that allows businesses to categorize their customer base into 
distinct groups with similar characteristics. This enhances targeted marketing efforts, 
optimizes resource allocation, and improves customer satisfaction. One effective 
method for customer segmentation is the K-means clustering algorithm, which groups 
customers based on defined variables such as purchasing behavior, demographics, 
or interaction history. This paper discusses the application of K-means clustering in R 
for customer segmentation, detailing the methodology, data preparation, model 
implementation, and results analysis
